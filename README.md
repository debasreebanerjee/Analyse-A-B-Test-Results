# Analyse-A/B-Test-Results

#### Introduction
In this project, we analysed the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The aim of this project was to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

#### Methodology
The project was carried out in Python 3 in Jupyter Notebook

##### Libraries installed
Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, StatsModels, Scipy

##### Statistical Analysis
1. Bootsrapping sampling distribution
2. p-value calculation
3. Z-score test
4. Logistic Regression
5. Multiple Linear Regression Modelling 

#### Key Findings
Based on the Probability analysis, A/B Test and Regression analysis, it is proved that the new page did not increase the conversion rate compared to the old page. Also, there was no effect of the country where the user lives on the convertion rate.
